# EasyMirror

Try to make mirror site easy!

this repo is modified from [zmirror](https://github.com/aploium/zmirror).

## Description

This project is a modified version of [zmirror](https://github.com/aploium/zmirror), a reverse proxy for creating website mirrors. The original author of zmirror is highly skilled, and my original intent was to learn from their work.

The original code in the zmirror repository was written as one long page, which made it difficult to read and understand. To improve the code structure and readability, I have modified it in an object-oriented manner.

Some functions have been removed from the original code for simplicity, but they can be added back in if necessary.

I would like to thank the original authors of zmirror for their great work, which served as an inspiration for this project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run the main program.

## Usage

you can refer to [zmirror](https://github.com/aploium/zmirror) for more details.

The modified zmirror reverse proxy can be used to create mirrors of websites. The proxy retrieves content from the original website and serves it to clients, allowing them to access the content even if the website is blocked or inaccessible.

To create a mirror of a website using the modified zmirror, follow these steps:

1. Configure the proxy settings in the `config.py` file.
2. Run the main program.
3. Access the mirror website using the proxy's URL.
